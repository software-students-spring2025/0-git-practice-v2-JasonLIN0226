## what I found interesting:

Before the introduction of DeepSeek, AI was often considered a highly expensive technology requiring significant resources for development. However, DeepSeek has made AI more accessible and cost-effective, offering a competitive alternative. By delivering strong performance at a lower cost, it has positioned itself as a challenger to leading AI chatbots like ChatGPT. This shift has sparked discussions about its potential impact on the global AI landscape, including the competitive dynamics of AI leadership.
